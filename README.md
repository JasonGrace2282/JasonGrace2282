  <summary><h3>Programming Experience</h3></summary>

  The language I know the best is [python](https://www.python.org/), which I've worked with for over six years.
  Some of the projects I've worked on include:
  * [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a mathematical animations library.
  * [Turn-In](https://github.com/tjcsl/tin/), a code autograder for CS classes used at TJHSST
  * [Raytracing](https://github.com/JasonGrace2282/raytracing), a program that simulates the light-matter interaction for photorealistic images.

  I'm also familiar with languages like:
  * Rust
  * C/C++
  * Lua
  * HTML/CSS/JS
  * Bash
  If you can name a language, I have probably tried it out :)
